# SEC-480 allis-480-utils script

This script was created by Ethan Allis in 2020. It was designed to provide the end user with all necessary tools to create and deploy full or linked clones to a selected vCenter instance. It does this by using PowerCLI commands as a base and providing the user a comfortable UI to navigate those commands. The goal of this project is to increase overall efficiency for individuals or teams working with large vcenter environments.
